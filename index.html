            <h1>Featured Posts in Twenty Eleven</h1>
            <p>Twenty Eleven uses Sticky Posts to power the Featured Post area on the Showcase Page Template. And it’s pretty easy to use. Just publish a Sticky Post and it’ll show up in the Featured Post area. If you add a Featured Image the same size as the Custom Header Image it’ll be used as a full-width image link to the post. If your Featured Image is smaller, it will neatly float to the right of your content. Neat, huh? If you have more than one Sticky Post featured you can view up to 10 of them on the showcase page using the circular links that appear at the bottom left of the Featured Post area. Totally neat.</p>
